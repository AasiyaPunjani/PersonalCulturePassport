        <p>This project explores what cultural identity means and addresses cultural dysphoria. 
            Cultural dysphoria can be defined as "the dissonance between the social expectations of an individual's
             cultural performance or identity, and their desired embodiment of that culture, or uncertainty about 
             where they fit into existing cultural categories" (Sharma, 2017). This could look like a disconnect from 
             one’s ethnic background as a result of immigration or growing up in the West, a divide between multiple 
             racial identities, or really any form of internal conflict that surrounds one’s cultural identity. We are 
             creating a new, non-conforming passport format that incapsulates everyone that feels they fall in-between 
             categories and are not tied to any one identity or fit in any box in regards to how they identify. This 
             website is a digital index of collected experiences in relation to cultural dysphoria. This can be used a 
             resource and a place to learn about other perspectives regarding personal culture.

                        I'm biracial and Brazilian, but I usually identify more with Brazilian black culture than white culture, even 
                        though most of our culture does not have distinctions between both races due to large miscegenation, that is 
                        why I added Brazilian culture in general first.

                        <br>
                        I honestly don't know (?)  I guess music is the biggest part of my cultural identity. Music and food. I have 
                        always been a picky eater but Canada really made that worse. Everything is different and textures are my worse 
                        nightmare, so being here did make things difficult, food-wise. Music is amazing because I get to listen to it 
                        and sing wherever I want and just feel a bit of my country with me. Brazil is so culturally rich, there is so 
                        much I get to experience and so much I miss everyday, but I'm confident I brought most of it with me.

                        <br>
                        I guess I'm pretty into Brazilian culture. Memes, all the different genres of music, our language and even the 
                        specific dialect I speak in my region. I feel like I culturally belong in my area because I know that I don't 
                        in Canada. I barely have any Brazilian friends so I've been through a lot of cultural shock and it was definitely 
                        a learning curve.

                    Being born into a family that has been immersed in the culture for generations, I haven’t spent a lot of time trying to define my cultural identity. However, as the years go by and the ’culture’ grapples with the skeletons in its closet, the meaning is certainly less defined.

                    Coming from an immigrant household, I was learning about Cantonese-Chinese culture at home. But when I left my home I had to learn about Canadian culture.

                    <br>
                    I would identify myself as Cantonese/Chinese and Canadian. However, I do consider those identities as separate. Though I grew up here in Canada and is mostly integrated into Canadian culture, I still feel distant from my Canadian identity as a whole. This is probably due to the fact I was raised in a family that was separated from Canadian culture. My family often upheld traditional Cantonese culture with me and was unable to understand English or Canadian culture overall. 

                    The connection with my Cantonese identity is much stronger than the one I have with my Canadian identity.                    <br>

                    Seeing foods and celebrations from my culture usually. The familiarity of it is comforting and reassuring for my identities. But I think for my Cantonese/Chinese identity hearing Cantonese or my dialect (Kaipingnese) being spoken warms my heart especially.

                    I identify with the cultures I listed above because my family ancestry and familial ties has a mix of varying backgrounds and identities, a fusion of cultures due to colonialism and the Indian diaspora

                    This is the eternal question for me; I still don’t quite know how to define it, the short answer is I identify as Anglo-Indian, a product of colonialism. It means many things to me, while at the same time, leaves me questioning, as I really don’t know my Indian roots beyond  the minimal information my parents gave me.

                    I identify with my nationality, Canadian, as it is the country I was born and raised in. Although it is not necessarily the strongest point of my cultural identity. I identify strongly with Greek culture as I am half Greek, speak Greek (although not as fluently anymore), have a mostly Greek name (my middle name Ekaterina for example is my grandmothers name), and much of my cultural values and social beliefs are influenced by it. I am close with my mother and grandparents who are Greek, and have made a lot of effort to preserve cultural practices where possible (minus the Greek Orthodox religion because I don’t remotely identify with it). I identify with Italian culture (although not as much as Greek), as I am half, and because it ewe a major part of my identity growing up as I used to be close with that side of my family. I identify with LGBTQ+ culture as someone who is queer and AFAB non-binary (I specify AFAB non-binary as many of my experiences are similar to that of cis women), as these are important parts of my identity, and because I am both very active in the culture, and associate with thy predominantly with people of LGBTQ+ identity.

                    <br>
                    I define my cultural identity as Greek-/Italian-Canadian, and AFAB queer non-binary. To me, this means a few things. I am Canadian-born, and so many of my values and beliefs are influenced by the country I was born in, and education I have received here (open-mindedness, recognition, acceptance and understanding of a variety of cultural identities outside of my own, etc). But I also identify with certain Greek cultural values that value collectivism, strong family (blood or chosen) and community, as well as similar Italian ones. Being queer and non-binary to me means to be a part of a culture that is accepting of others regardless of how they identify, and who looks past the identities themselves. And similar to Greek-Italian culture, strong community oriented values. Although it should be noted that in many ways, all of these components of my cultural identity clash heavily with one another. Canadian culture is (at least in theory) a lot more accepting of multicultural and LGBTQ+ identities compared to Greek-Italian culture, which tends to less accepting of others who are not of these cultures. And much of Greek culture in particular is also centred around the Greek-Orthodox church, who activity detests my existence as a queer nb person, and my non-religious lifestyle in general. Although that being said, countries like Greece/Italy are more culturally collectivist and community oriented compared to Canada’s increasingly individualistic culture that often makes me feel very isolated.

                    At an internal level, feeling truly comfortable and content with the culture I am apart of. Sometimes pride, but I wouldn’t say that’s the dominant feeling. At an external level, social acceptance by those close to me mostly, but the broader population of the culture as well.

                    I don't really think I have a cultural identity, I mostly just consider myself white and have little culture connection to anything I do identify with. like I am jewish but only because my mom is, I'm not religious and don't really feel connected to the religion at all, other than like when we celebrate different holidays. Same thing with being russian, I'm half russian but I don't even know russian.. is being russian even genetic??? idk LOL

                    I come from a biracial family with a white father and asian mother. I was brought up to appreciate both of my cultures and was allowed to express each in their own way. I am the child of both of my parents allowing me to identify with them both.

                    <br>
                    I would define myself as being a biracial individual, with the two cultures being Japanese and Irish. This is something that is extremely important to me and is something I have stepped up in claiming within my more recent years. I think it's so interesting to have two extremely different cultures apart of myself with their own flavour to help create the person I am.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I don't feel as if I culturally belong to one side or the other as I am equally both. I think my sense of belonging has come within myself and my sibling, being able to reflect with each other on the vastly different cultures we both belong to. I think the sense of culturally belonging comes from being able to be fully seen and appreciated by either side. Being able to be called and celebrated for being Japanese while also being called and celebrated for being Irish is what allows me to truly feel like I belong. I don't feel as if I need to belong to them as they already belong to me equally.
